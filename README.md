# Minesweeper-AI

Minesweeper is a puzzle game that consists of a grid of cells, where some of the cells contain hidden “mines.” Clicking on a cell that contains a mine detonates the mine, and causes the user to lose the game. Clicking on a “safe” cell (i.e., a cell that does not contain a mine) reveals a number that indicates how many neighboring cells – where a neighbor is a cell that is one square to the left, right, up, down, or diagonal from the given cell – contain a mine. The goal of the game is to flag (i.e., identify) each of the mines. In many implementations of the game, including the one in this project, the player can flag a mine by right-clicking on a cell (or two-finger clicking, depending on the computer).

The runner.py file runs a working game of minesweeper, and the minesweeper.py runs a program that solves the game using AI. The game is manually playable, but offers a button "AI Move" which can be held to make the most ideal move. The program is based on knowledge-based propositional logic that allows the computer to identify and remember mines based on the placement of safe spots.
